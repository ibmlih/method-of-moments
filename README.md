# PLINK's Method-of-Moments

`project.ipynb` contains my implementation of method-of-moments as well as the code for plotting and calculating MSE.
 
 Unzip `ps2_ibd.lwk.chr1.ped.zip` to get `ps2_ibd.lwk.chr1.ped`, which is the dataset used by my implementation. However, any `.ped` file can be used.
 
 `my.ibd.genome` contains the result of running my implementation of method-of-moments on `ps2_ibd.lwk.chr1.ped`, which contains chromosome 1 SNPs for 97 individuals in LWK population.
 
 `plink.ibd.genome` contains the result of running PLINK's own implementation on `ps2_ibd.lwk.*`, which contains all autosomal SNPs for 97 individuals in LWK population. `ps2_ibd.lwk.*` is not included in this repository due to the size limit.
